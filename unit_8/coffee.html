		<h5>USER RESEARCH</h5>

			<p><span class="bold">Real-time opening information:</span> Management sometimes closes early leaving customers in the dark. With real-time hours on the Corner Coffee app, customers can save themselves the trip and management receives fewer customer complaints.</p><br>

			<p><span class="bold">Deals and coupons:</span> With plenty of coffee shops to choose from, loyal customers want perks. By downloading the app, customers have quick access to the latest deals and coupons which can easily be redeemed by just showing the coupon on their mobile device.
			</p><br>

			<p><span class="bold">Book a table:</span> No one wants to wait in line - let customers book ahead for a better coffee shop experience both online and in real life.</p><br>
</div>
  <div class="column">
			<p><span class="bold">Event listings and search:</span> Corner Coffee is not only a coffee shop but a community space for gatherings and events. By including events information in the app, customers may easily see what's happening at Coffee Corner in a few taps based on their unique interests. </p><br>

			<p><span class="bold">Food and drinks menu:</span> Let's face it: no one eats or drinks without looking up the menu first. For regular customers and new customers alike, the in-app menu keeps everyone up-to-date on Corner Coffee's tasty offerings and seasonal specialties. </p>

		<h5>USER FLOWS AND WIREFRAMES</h5>

		<p class="first-para">With the user at the center of this app's design, I was able to take the chief features and create an interface that allows end-users to complete tasks with the least amount of clicks or taps possible.

		<h5>HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h5>

		<p class="first-para">Having completed usability testing with wireframes, all user feedback was used to inform this high fidelity prototype. It features a clean, responsive design for all screens while staying true to Coffee Corner's well-known brand.</p>
