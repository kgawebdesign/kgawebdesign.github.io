			<p><span class="list-bold">CLIENT: </span>Company X</p>
			
			<p><span class="list-bold">SOFTWARE: </span>Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Server Integration Services, Visual Basic for Applications, Excel</p><br>

	<p>Company X are world-leading manufacturers of soft contact lenses and related products and services.</p>

	<p>To accommodate their rapid growth, they purchased a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. </p> 

	<p>As principal developer for global resupply and UK manufacturing scheduling systems, I worked with an international, cross-functional team to ensure a seamless integration with regional applications.  </p>
	<br>
	<img class="erp-title" src="images/ERP/title_taking_stock.jpeg">
	<br>


	<p>THIS WAS A PHASED INTEGRATION and my systems were staying. My first action was to analyse touch points with the systems being replaced. </p>

	<br>
	<p>I identified data fields that were dependent on the disappearing systems and mapped them to equivalent data sources in the ERP system.  After consulting business area specialists, I discovered that this was far more than a remapping exercise.  The item codes, fundamental to all processes, would be changing beyond recognition.  </p>

	<br>
	<img class="erp-green" src="images/ERP/green_item_codes_changing.jpeg">
	<br>

	<p>THE CHANGES WOULD HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON MY USERS.  Having supported them through a recent company acquisition, I knew they would have concerns.  I held a briefing with them, and came away with these points:
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	With the new item codes, how do we know we're sending the right lenses to the right customers?

	We're already having to learn a new ERP system, will we have to relearn these applications too?  

	Will we have all the functions we have now?

	Not more work, please!

	Will they have the correct supply in inventory?

	Will item codes follow through the whole process without a hitch?

	What happens if it all falls over?
</p>
<br>
<p>It was going to be a long road (and a steep learning curve) for my users. I planned to make their journey as easy as possible. I would: 
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>simplify systems where possible</li>
		<li>automate labour-intensive processes</li>
		<li>create familiar interfaces to minimise learning overhead</li>
		<li>cover all functionality for a seamless transition</li>
		<li>provide an uninterrupted service on go-live</li>
	</ul>
 </p>
<br>

<p>TOGETHER WITH THE USERS, I reviewed existing functionality and data, to identify obsolete processes.  This would reduce development time and cognitive load.  

I then analysed the impact of the item code and product grouping changes and shared my proposed designs with the users.  Layout changes were kept as minimal as possible.  

To address users' concerns about mistakes with new item codes, I included an "Old Item" column for cross referencing.

I liaised with members of the project team to ensure that all essential functions would be covered in the new ERP system.

I verified formats for input and output files, created new item code translation routines for overseas branches, and compiled transit and order information, for users to access through their familiar tools.  

I created new ETL (extract transform and load) packages, updated programs and spreadsheet formulas.  This was invisible to the users; they just saw the results they needed.

<p>WE WERE DEVELOPING while the master data team were still working on the item codes.  In a project briefing I asked when the dry item codes would be ready.  The response was a complete surprise: they would not be producing them for this release, as manufacturing was not migrating to the ERP system.  These codes and their links to unlabelled and finished items were crucial to my users' work.  </p>

<img class="erp-green" src="images/ERP/title_advocating.jpeg">

<p>I drew process flows to explain to the team.  The project leaders considered it not to be a concern, as manufacturing was outside the scope for the first release.
</p>
<br>
<p>I explained that it would be a concern when the manufacturing teams were operating blind.  

	  Not enough inventory and we'd have back orders, disgruntled customers, and potential loss of trade. 
 
	  Too much and we'd have valuable warehouse space taken up, expired stock, and wastage.

Both would have negative financial implications 
for the business.  
</p>
<br>
<p>Dry items and their links were added to the project plan, and we were back on track. </p>
<br>
<p>
I performed end-to-end testing in the development environment.  My users were able to quickly understand new item structures, and performed usability testing with very little need for guidance.

<p>IN THE INTEGRATED TEST environment, I discovered non-product-line data in the master item table's product line field.  A conversation with a US database administrator revealed that an analyst from another business area had requested it.  It had not been approved by the project steering committee.  My users needed the field for reports and inventory rules.
</p>

<img class="erp-green" src="images/ERP/title_alternative_route.jpeg">

<p>Due to tight time constraints, and the amount of work the database administrators had already done, the field would remain populated with the alien data. I examined the table for fields of the same size and data type, and found one, currently unpopulated.  After checking with every analyst that it was unused, I proposed that it become the new product line field.  The proposal was approved by the steering committee. 

Amendments made to my applications, a successful integrated test was performed.  The change was invisible to my users. 
</p>

<p>THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN had a backout strategy:
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>back up the database at close of businessthe day before go-live, ready to...</li>
		<li>restore from backup</li>
		<li>reinstate old ETL jobs</li>
		<li>restore reports from backup directory</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Whatever happened on go-live day, the users would have a working system.
